![Venice](https://raw.github.com/mattt/nomad-cli.com/assets/venice-banner.png)

Venice is a simple gem for verifying Apple In-App Purchase receipts, and retrieving the information associated with receipt data.

There are two reasons why you should verify in-app purchase receipts on the server: First, it allows you to keep your own records of past purchases, which is useful for up-to-the-minute metrics and historical analysis. Second, server-side verification over SSL is the most reliable way to determine the authenticity of purchasing records.

See Apple's [In-App Purchase Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/VerifyingStoreReceipts/VerifyingStoreReceipts.html) for additional information.

> Venice is named for [Venice, Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Italy)â€”or more specifically, Shakespeare's [_The Merchant of Venice_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice).
> It's part of a series of world-class command-line utilities for iOS development, which includes [Cupertino](https://github.com/mattt/cupertino) (Apple Dev Center management), [Shenzhen](https://github.com/mattt/shenzhen) (Building & Distribution), [Houston](https://github.com/mattt/houston) (Push Notifications), and [Dubai](https://github.com/mattt/dubai) (Passbook pass generation).
